note over browser:
User clicks button on the form, 
however, the JavaScript the code 
the browser fetched from the server
handles the submit event, preventing
the default handling on form submit, 
which would have caused a new GET
request. Instead, the event handler 
creates the new note, renders it and
sends the new note to the server in 
JSON format.
end note

browser->server: HTTP POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
server-->browser: HTTP status 201

note:

and browser stays on the same page.
